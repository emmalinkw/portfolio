I'm Emma Lin K.W., a full-stack developer who crafts user-focused solutions across web, mobile, and desktop.
With strong experience in Vue.js, Laravel, and Flutter, I bridge frontend finesse with backend stability — and even explore game dev with Godot and Phaser.js.

What sets me apart? I care about clarity, maintainability, and how technology feels in the hands of real people.
I don’t just build things that work — I build things that last and feel good to use.
